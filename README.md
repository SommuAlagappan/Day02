**Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript**

**Answer:** JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods..
In Javascript, Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
Here var is named as car  
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel}
Here the values are written as name:value pairs 
The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
Model: “C-Class”  - Here Model is Property, C Class is Property value
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only
In simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.
An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
Java Script Object methods is “Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.”.
